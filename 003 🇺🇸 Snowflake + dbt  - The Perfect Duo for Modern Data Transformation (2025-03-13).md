### Snowflake + dbt: Transforming Data with Simplicity & Power 🛠️

While Snowflake handles **scalable storage** and **compute**, dbt focuses on **automating data transformations** and providing **version-controlled** SQL models that are easy to deploy.

### Why Combine dbt with Snowflake?

- **Modular, SQL-Based Transformations**: dbt uses **SQL** for defining models, making it easy for analysts to create **data transformations** while Snowflake handles the underlying compute power.
- **Automated Data Testing & Documentation**: dbt not only runs tests on your data, but also generates **automatic documentation** and **lineage** reports, helping your team maintain **data quality**.
- **CI/CD for Data**: dbt integrates smoothly with **CI/CD pipelines**, automating the deployment of data models, making it easier to collaborate across teams.

### Step-by-Step: Getting Started with dbt and Snowflake

- **Set Up Snowflake Profile in dbt**  
     Begin by configuring your Snowflake credentials in the `profiles.yml` file:
```
your_project:  
  target: dev  
  outputs:  
    dev:  
      type: snowflake  
      account: your_snowflake_account  
      user: your_username  
      password: your_password  
      role: your_role  
      database: your_database  
      warehouse: your_warehouse  
      schema: your_schema  
      threads: 4
```
- **Create dbt Models**  
     In dbt, models are just SQL queries that transform your raw data. Here’s an example:

📌 **models/orders.sql**
```
SELECT   
    order_id,   
    customer_id,   
    total_price,   
    status,   
    created_at  
FROM raw.orders  
WHERE status != 'cancelled'
```
Run your transformations with:
```
dbt run
```
### 🔍 Ensuring Data Quality with dbt Tests in Snowflake

dbt tests help you maintain **data quality** and ensure that the transformations produce **accurate results**.  
One of the most powerful features of **dbt** is its **automated testing framework**, which helps maintain **data integrity** in Snowflake before deploying transformations.

### 💡 How dbt Tests Work

dbt allows you to **define tests at the column level** inside your `schema.yml` file. These tests automatically **validate assumptions about the data**, ensuring **clean and reliable datasets**.

There are **two types of tests** in dbt:  
**1- Generic tests** — Pre-built tests like `unique`, `not_null`, and `accepted_values`.  
 **2-** **Custom tests** – SQL-based assertions for **advanced validation**.

### 📌 Example: Basic dbt Tests in Snowflake

Let’s say we have an **orders table** in Snowflake, and we want to ensure:  
 ✅ **Order IDs are unique** (no duplicates).  
 ✅ **Total price is never negative** (ensuring accurate transactions).  
 ✅ **Status only contains valid values** (e.g., `pending`, `shipped`, `delivered`).

Define these rules inside `schema.yml`:
```
version: 2  
models:  
  - name: orders  
    description: "Processed orders excluding cancelled ones"  
    columns:  
      - name: order_id  
        tests:  
          - unique  
          - not_null  
      - name: total_price  
        tests:  
          - not_null  
          - custom_test: "total_price >= 0"  
      - name: status  
        tests:  
          - accepted_values:  
              values: ['pending', 'shipped', 'delivered']
```
### 🛠️ Running dbt Tests in Snowflake

After defining your tests, simply execute:
```
dbt test
```
This runs **SQL assertions in Snowflake** to detect data quality issues. If a test fails, dbt will generate **a report showing which records didn’t pass the validation**.

### 🛡️ Why dbt Tests Matter

✅ **Prevent Data Corruption** — Catch errors before they impact downstream reports.  
 ✅ **Automate Data Governance** — Ensure data quality **without manual checks**.  
 ✅ **Build Trust in Your Data** — Confidence in analytics leads to better decision-making.

With **dbt + Snowflake**, you can **proactively validate your data**, ensuring your team always works with **accurate, high-quality information**. 🚀❄️

**2. Incremental Models**  
 Instead of processing all the data every time, dbt’s **incremental models** only update new data, reducing computational costs in Snowflake. For example:

📌 **models/incremental_orders.sql**
```
{{ config(materialized='incremental', unique_key='order_id') }}  
SELECT   
    order_id,   
    customer_id,   
    total_price,   
    status,   
    created_at  
FROM raw.orders  
WHERE created_at > (SELECT MAX(created_at) FROM {{ this }})
```

GitHub Actions allows you to define **workflows** directly in your GitHub repository, giving you complete control over your **testing** and **deployment processes**.

#### Steps to Set Up CI/CD with GitHub Actions:

1. **Create a GitHub Repository for Your dbt Project**  
     If you don’t have a GitHub repository for your dbt project, create one and push your dbt models there.
2. **Create a GitHub Actions Workflow**  
     In the root directory of your project, create a `.github/workflows/dbt-ci.yml` file. This YAML file defines your workflow for testing and deploying dbt models. Here’s an example workflow:
```
name: dbt CI/CD Pipeline  
on:  
  push:  
    branches:  
      - main  # Trigger on push to main branch  
  pull_request:  
    branches:  
      - main  # Trigger on pull request to main branch  
  
jobs:  
  dbt_run:  
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest  
    steps:  
    - name: Checkout repository  
      uses: actions/checkout@v2  
    - name: Set up Python  
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2  
      with:  
        python-version: '3.8'  
    - name: Install dependencies  
      run: |  
        pip install dbt-snowflake  
        pip install snowflake-connector-python  
    - name: Configure Snowflake credentials  
      run: |  
        echo "SNOWFLAKE_USER=$SNOWFLAKE_USER" >> $GITHUB_ENV  
        echo "SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD=$SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD" >> $GITHUB_ENV  
        echo "SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT=$SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT" >> $GITHUB_ENV  
        echo "SNOWFLAKE_WAREHOUSE=$SNOWFLAKE_WAREHOUSE" >> $GITHUB_ENV  
        echo "SNOWFLAKE_DATABASE=$SNOWFLAKE_DATABASE" >> $GITHUB_ENV  
        echo "SNOWFLAKE_SCHEMA=$SNOWFLAKE_SCHEMA" >> $GITHUB_ENV  
    - name: Run dbt tests  
      run: |  
        dbt run --profiles-dir .  # Run transformations  
        dbt test --profiles-dir .  # Run tests  
    - name: Deploy to Snowflake  
      run: |  
        dbt run --profiles-dir .  # Deploy models to Snowflake
```
- **Configure Snowflake Credentials**  
     In the **GitHub repository settings**, store your **Snowflake credentials** as **GitHub Secrets** (e.g., `SNOWFLAKE_USER`, `SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD`, etc.). This will allow your workflow to access Snowflake securely during the pipeline runs.
- **Test and Deploy**  
     Once the workflow is set up, every **push** to your repository or **pull request** to the main branch will trigger the **dbt run** and **dbt test** commands. This ensures:   
     - **Automated testing** of your models.  
    - **Automatic deployment** of your changes to Snowflake.

**Monitor and Debug**  
 GitHub Actions provides detailed logs of each workflow run. If any tests fail or if there’s an issue during the deployment, you can easily troubleshoot by reviewing the logs.

**Why GitHub Actions?**

- **Highly customizable** for advanced workflows.
