# 🚀Start Smart: Don’t Start from Scratch. Start with Strategy.

One of the biggest challenges in launching new projects — whether you're a solo founder, part of a startup, or leading a team in a large company — is starting *right*.

We’ve all been there:  
👉 Endless documents.  
👉 Lack of structure.  
👉 Lessons learned — too late.  
👉 Time wasted repeating avoidable mistakes.

That’s why I created **Start Smart**.
